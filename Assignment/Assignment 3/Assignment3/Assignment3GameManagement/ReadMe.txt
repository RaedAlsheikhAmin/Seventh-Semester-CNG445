Each feature (e.g., search, genre-based filtering, user authentication) was tested separately before integrating it into the full system.


During the assignment, we used the following additional resources to guide our development:

Flask Documentation: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/
SQLite Documentation: https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html
W3Schools HTML/CSS Tutorials: https://www.w3schools.com/
Stack Overflow: For quick solutions to specific bugs and challenges.
CNG445 Lecture Notes: Provided foundational guidance for project requirements.
